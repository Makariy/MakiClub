Since you\u2019ll be eating the whole fruit including the peel, you might want to buy organic citrus, if available.\nChoose juicy lemons and limes with a thinner skin and a small amount of give when you press it with your fingers. Rock hard, thick-skinned citrus should be avoided here. It\u2019ll be too bitter.\nBlend the dressing on low speed for a perfectly emulsified dressing, which means the oil will not separate and it will be thick and creamy. Take your time to blend it so that your dressing gets, and stays, emulsified.\nUnless you\u2019re using the dressing immediately, opt for a neutral oil, not olive oil. Olive oil solidifies in the fridge, so the dressing will be difficult to use unless warmed through after being stored in the fridge.\nSlice the citrus as thinly as possible, no more than 1/4-inch thick. Sometimes I find it easier to slice it with a mandoline.\nI like a cast iron pan for the charring, but any heavy-bottomed pan will do. A cast iron pan yields the best result because it offers a stable source of heat, which means the citrus chars gently without ever burning.\n", "type": "text"}, {"image_link": "https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/3VbmVmtPuu3WYAHfxOJGkt6TLTo=/2800x4200/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Simply-Recipes-Charred-Citrus-DressingLEAD-15-69d357659b474886893c426b6f035234.jpg", "type": "image"}, {"text": "\nThis is a versatile dressing.
