You\u2019re grinding the lime peels with the sugar, and you need some abrasion to release the oils. Granulated sugar will do that. Anything finer will dissolve before you even start muddling the limes.Muddling can mean many things to many people so let\u2019s talk about that here for a second. The purpose of muddling is to grind the sugar with the lime juice and oils from its peel. You\u2019re lightly crushing the sugar with quartered limes, maybe giving it all a stir as you go. You do not want to mangle the lime quarters to shreds\u2014at that point you\u2019ve gone too far.The flavor of a Caipirinha depends on the brand of cacha\u00e7a you use. If the opportunity arises to taste a few, it could help you find the right one for you. I use Leblon, a relatively grassy and funky tasting cacha\u00e7a that can benefit with a little more sugar to balance it out. Novo Fogo is fruitier and sweeter, so you can pull back on the sugar a little.Consider the lime. Look for a plump juicy one that will add some liquid to your cocktail. Forgo anything that looks dry and withered. You may need to add more or less sugar depending on how tart or sweet the limes are. Give it a little taste before making the cocktail.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nSince you need to have a bit of a heavy hand while making this to muddle the limes, a heavy-bottomed glass is ideal.
