But it takes a long time to grate the number of potatoes and onions that you need. And there's always the risk of nicking your knuckle in the process,\u201d Koenig explains.\u00a0\u201cThere are all these jokes that your latkes don't taste right unless there's a little bit of knuckle in there. But that's gross! I don't abide by that.\u201d\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nWhat does she recommend you use instead? A food processor. \u201cMost standard food processors come with the shred blade, and it really makes short work of grating the potatoes,\u201d she explains. Not only is this an easier method, it\u2019s also just plain faster. \"When time is of the essence and you're trying to get your holiday dinner on the table, you might as well cut that step,\u201d Koenig says.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nOnce you\u2019re finished grating your potatoes, it\u2019s time to squeeze out all of the liquid. \u201cWrap the potatoes in a clean dish towel and literally wring them out,\u201d explains Koenig. \u201cThat adage about oil and water not mixing is true. You'll get much less splatter if you really squeeze the potatoes and the onions out.\u201d The solution? Squeeze the potatoes twice. \u201cOnce you've squeezed them and you think you've gotten all the liquid out, do it again,\u201d says Koenig. \u201cYou will be surprised that there's still more left to squeeze out.\u201d\n", "type": "text"}, {"image_link": "https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/2Htt-C9_fbS_OV9tt7aRKUyLi6k=/2000x1333/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__simply_recipes__uploads__2017__10__2017-11-08-Latkes-4-486d5ce2d92d4d49abb954a3a05bfb23.jpg", "type": "image"}, {"text": "\nDon\u2019t get rid of that starchy liquid after squeezing out those potatoes! It\u2019s a secret ingredient for adding more flavor to your latkes. \u201cWhen you squeeze the potatoes, squeeze them into a bowl as opposed to over the sink. Then, let that liquid sit for 10 to 15 minutes,\u201c suggests Koenig. \u201cWhat you'll notice is that the heavier potato starch falls to the bottom, and the liquid floats to the top. So, if you pour off the liquid, you're left with this really great potato starch.\u201d\u00a0\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nAccording to Koenig, adding a little bit of the potato starch back into the latke mixture imbues texture and flavor, and also works as a binder. \u201cIt really helps to crisp things up in the pan, and you can notice a difference in flavor,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt also helps keep the latke together. Sure, you're putting eggs in to bind them; that really is what keeps them together. But usually you put in some kind of\u00a0flour or matzo meal or potato starch, too. So, it does\u00a0augment or take the place of the flour.\u201d\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nThe\u00a0type of oil you use for frying alongside the temperature of the oil is incredibly important. Koenig suggests using a neutral oil with a high smoking point. \u201cI love sunflower oil. It has that Eastern European vibe. So, that's my favorite.\u201d Koenig explains. She also recommends grapeseed oil and safflower oil. She doesn\u2019t recommend using extra virgin olive oil because it has a low smoke point.

So, you end up with a very soggy, heavy potato latke,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf it's too hot, then you risk burning the outside before the inside has had a chance to bind and cook.\u201d Koenig suggests investing in a thermometer to ensure the right temperature for your oil.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nKoenig also says you should avoid crowding the pan with too many latkes, because this will lower the temperature of the oil too quickly. \u201c You want to cook maybe batches of five or six at the most depending on the size of your pan,\u201d she says.\n", "type": "text"}, {"image_link": "https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/On_Z0Wui6k9kurGL6VdZBxuCBfw=/2000x1333/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__simply_recipes__uploads__2017__10__2017-11-08-Latkes-8-425648478d664436baf79a9e1dc4c294.jpg", "type": "image"}, {"text": "\nDid you know that the original latkes were actually not made out of potato?
