Broadly speaking, room temperature ingredients are best. This is the optimal temperature for creaming butter and sugar together and aerating the batter effectively.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nRoom temperature butter is soft: you can easily indent it with your finger, and it should not feel greasy or melt. Ideally, butter should be between 65\u00b0F and 70\u00b0F. Depending on your kitchen temperature, this means about an hour or two out of the fridge. (Shortbread is an exception; in that case the butter should be colder to make a flakier, tender cookie.)\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nEggs should also be at room temperature. If refrigerator-cold eggs are added, the butter will seize, breaking the creamed butter and sugar mixture. Any other ingredients should also be at a similar temperature for the same reason. Melted chocolate should be slightly cooled. Any liquids, such as milk or buttermilk, and ingredients like sour cream, should also warm up to room temperature before mixing.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nOven temperature and preheating the oven are also important variables in baking.

If the dough is too warm when you try to roll it out, it's more likely to stick to your counter, to your rolling pin, to your cookie-cutter, to your hands; you get the messy picture. Cut-out cookies also hold their shape better if they\u2019re cold when they go into the oven.
