Think a meatloaf or a baked pasta, but divided into four portions. The loaf pan is filled one third to halfway with the dish, and goes in the oven to bake. Once done, you take it out and pop a cooked veggie on the other side. Another method I love is to place uncooked veggies\u2014cut in appropriately sized pieces to cook similarly\u2014next to a protein or casserole, and let everything cook together. My favorite loaf pan meal is a baked rigatoni on one side, then when it comes out of the oven all bubbly I add a spinach salad to the other side. The loaf pan's heat wilts the salad perfectly.\u00a0\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nLoaf pan cooking works best for solid foods (so no soups and stews). You can turn any baked meal for one to four people into a loaf pan dinner by dividing your portions between loaf pans.
