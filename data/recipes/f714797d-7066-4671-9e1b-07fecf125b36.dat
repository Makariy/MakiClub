If you don\u2019t have a kitchen scale, make sure you\u2019re measuring it accurately\u2014fluff the flour in its container, spoon it into the measuring cup, then gently sweep off the excess flour by scraping the flat edge of a knife over the measuring cup.Chill the dough: The dough is soft, so it yields soft cookies. It\u2019s hard to work with if you don\u2019t chill it first. For evenly sized cookies, chill the dough for at least an hour (and longer is even better).Measure the dough: You could eyeball the portions for most cookie recipes. For this recipe, it\u2019s important to measure each portion of dough. That way you\u2019ll end up with evenly sized cookies that make evenly sized sandwiches. A cookie scoop or a one tablespoon measuring spoon help ensure you get even portions. Another alternative: Scoop and weigh out the cookie dough\u2014they should be 22 grams each.Grease the cookie scoop: A light spritz of cooking spray will help the slightly sticky cookie dough emerge from the cookie scoop in one piece. Reapply every few scoops or as needed.Pipe the filling: For ultra-neat sandwich cookies, you can transfer the lemon filling into a piping bag or zip top bag with the corner snipped off and pipe it onto the cookies.\n", "type": "text"}, {"image_link": "https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/Kp9M2ZPHYSPF6dDjdR04OX9AYYg=/4256x2832/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Simply-Recipes-Gingerbread-Sandwiches-with-Lemon-Filling-LEAD-7-8432ad717f344a3bbb864f36ba6ba012.jpg", "type": "image"}, {"title": " Yummy Variations ", "type": "title"}, {"text": "\nI wouldn\u2019t suggest tweaking these cookies too much since every change will affect the texture and bake time.
