You can use super-fine almond flour made with blanched almonds.Egg whites: This key ingredient is whipped to make the meringue, which is what gives macarons their unique look and texture. Only fresh egg whites will work for macarons because they whip up easier and better. If you can find unpasteurized liquid egg whites at your local grocery store, they will work wonderfully. Unfortunately, it may be hard to source in the U.S.Powdered sugar gives our cookie just a bit of sweetness!Granulated sugar is slowly added to the egg whites as they are whipped to help stabilize them into a stiff meringue.Cream of tartar also helps stabilize the egg white meringue.\n", "type": "text"}, {"title": " Macaron Success: Tips and Tricks ", "type": "title"}, {"text": "\nMaking macarons can be tricky. Follow these simple tips and tricks for a successful bake:\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nNever make macarons on a rainy day! A meringue's worst enemy is moisture. This also applies to running your dishwasher or washing dishes in hot water. The steam could break your macaron batter.\nFlip your baking sheet upside down and bake the shells on the bottom (which is now the top!) of the baking sheet. Macarons are sensitive to heat, so flipping your baking sheet upside down will help distribute some of the heat coming from the bottom of the oven and prevent them from baking too quickly.\nWipe down your mixing bowl with distilled white vinegar. The second thing a meringue does not like is fat. Any traces of fat on the bowl, such as soap that wasn't completely washed off, can mean your meringue doesn't whip up. To prevent this from happening, wipe the bowl with a paper towel soaked with some vinegar.\nMeasure the ingredients using a kitchen scale. Although you can have success without it, I recommended weighing the ingredients. This will ensure you have the most accurate measurements possible.\nMake sure the egg whites are at room temperature so the meringue gets the most volume. It's best to separate the eggs while they're cold, then let the egg whites sit out on the counter until they're at room temperature. If you're pressed for time, place the egg whites in a sealable container and place it in a bowl full of hot tap water. Your egg whites will be warm in 5 to 10 minutes!\n", "type": "text"}, {"image_link": "https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/U5n3eCku0EbZ9d2QQ4_JQ0bYzv0=/4160x6240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Simply-Recipes-Chocolate-Macarons-Lead-1-38e3cc85ffe44d85bb7d693409522c35.jpg", "type": "image"}, {"title": " Ways to Fill and Flavor Macarons ", "type": "title"}, {"text": "\nMacarons are extremely versatile, and since the flavor almost always comes in the form of the filling, the variations are endless.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nWhen making ganache infuse the cream with mint, orange zest, chilies, or rosemary.\nSwap the dark chocolate for milk, white chocolate, bitter-sweet, or semi-sweet chocolate.\nGo beyond chocolate and fill these chocolate macarons with Strawberry Buttercream, French Buttercream, or jam.\n", "type": "text"}, {"title": " Tips for Storing Macarons ", "type": "title"}, {"text": "\nOnce the macarons have been assembled, keep them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to one week.
