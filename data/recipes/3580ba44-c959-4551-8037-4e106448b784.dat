Do not use almond flour or meal unless it is labeled as blanched and super-fine.Powdered sugar is added to the almond meal for a little sweetness. It works better than granulated sugar because it is finer in texture.I recommend using the freshest egg whites you can get ahold of. The egg whites are whipped into a meringue, which gives the shells their unique texture and height.Granulated sugar and cream of tartar are added to the egg whites to help stabilize the meringue. This means the air and bubbles you create to make the meringue tall and fluffy won\u2019t deflate.Food coloring is added to the batter for a boost of color. Use gel food coloring instead of liquid food coloring so that the batter does not thin out too much.

I wipe the inside of my bowl with a little distilled white vinegar to get rid of any residual grease.\nKitchen scale: I\u2019ve provided you with measurements in grams. Macaron batter can be temperamental so it's important to have the right ratio of ingredients. Weighing the ingredients with a kitchen scale will give you the most consistent and accurate amounts.\nStand mixer: I use a Kitchen Aid stand mixer with a whisk attachment to make the batter. Although it can be done with a handheld electric mixer, it will be more difficult.\nPastry bag and pastry tip: I use a 12- to 18-inch pastry bag and a #12 Wilton round pastry tip.

An upside-down baking sheet distributes the heat coming from the bottom of the oven more evenly, preventing the macarons from baking too quickly.Room temperature egg whites whip up faster, easier, and more consistently than cold egg whites.Always shake the food coloring bottle before using to redistribute the color dye and liquid.Make sure to mature the macarons in the fridge overnight after assembling them.
