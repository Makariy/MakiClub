It mixes up quickly, but it will take about 40 minutes to bake through. Start checking it at the 30- minute mark by inserting a wooden skewer into the loaf. Once it comes out clean without any wet batter on it, the bread is ready.When baked properly, the top of the loaf should be a golden brown. If for some reason your loaf appears to be darkening too quickly, tent it with a sheet of foil. I find this technique helpful when I top the loaf with chopped hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds, or shredded cheddar cheese.To get a proper measurement of the beer, pour the beer into a measuring cup and let the foam settle. You could pour a 12-ounce container of beer directly into the flour mixture. It will bubble up so make sure the bowl is large enough to accommodate it.Use room temperature beer for this recipe.
