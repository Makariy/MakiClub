For this reason, white vinegar is the go-to vinegar for substituting cream of tartar, since it has the least distinct flavor.Lemon juice: If you\u2019d rather not use vinegar, fresh lemon juice is a good option. It acts in the exact same way as vinegar and should be used in the same ratio: use four times more lemon juice than cream of tartar.
