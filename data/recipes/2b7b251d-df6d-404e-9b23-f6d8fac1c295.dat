I need to know if Kelly is going to pick Brandon or Dylan!). Those were simpler times.

From Orville Redenbacher\u2019s sprinkle-over cheddar microwave popcorn (which apparently no longer exists!?) to a fresh bag of Smartfood, I\u2019ve never met a bag of cheese popcorn I didn\u2019t like.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nBut I love Cousin Willie\u2019s the most because of its subtle Parmesan-y flavor, with a nice round nuttiness that telegraphs: real cheese within. And thankfully, unlike a lot of other cheese popcorn brands, it doesn\u2019t coat the fingers in cheese dust, which, while objectively delicious, is also kind of gross, especially on the hands of my children.\u00a0\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nSometimes though, if I want to amp up the umami level, I might add a sprinkle of Hidden Valley Ranch powder to the bag right out of the microwave and then shake it all up for maximum coverage, or I\u2019ll shake some nutritional yeast on top as a kind of homemade flavor blasting that renders the popcorn so crave-worthy it will visit you in dreams.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nThis family treat is a product of a 77-year-old family-owned company. In 1944, Edward and Agnes Sieg started the company with corn grown on 10 acres in Ramsey, Indiana, selling raw popcorn from store to store out of the back of a pickup truck. In 1960, the next generation of Siegs carried on the family business, starting Ramsey Popcorn Company, which owns the Cousin Willie\u2019s brand as well as Simply Better.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nWhile the packaging has changed a bit over the years, it consistently features an illustration of the original Cousin Willie, Wilfred E. Sieg Sr. who, in his cowboy hat and red suspenders, looks an awful lot like a midwestern version of my own dad. Ramsey Popcorn Co sells about 50 million pounds of popcorn annually worldwide and is a supplier for the Boy Scouts of America.\n", "type": "text"}, {"text": "\nOne bag of Cousin Willie\u2019s White Cheddar Popcorn is perfect to split between two people, so when my daughters get home from school, they do just that. My older daughter pops a bag in the microwave, smashes that 2 minute button, and a couple minutes later, they\u2019re cozied up with their snack. They might not be watching 90210 reruns (yet!?), but they\u2019re still carrying on an after school tradition I hold dear.\n", "type": "text"}]}
